# CRUD: Foundation & Principles
### With a better understanding of RESTful architecture, it’s time to dive into CRUD. CRUD is an acronym for:

#### CREATE
#### READ
#### UPDATE
#### DELETE
### These form the standard database commands that are the foundation of CRUD. Many software developers view these commands as primitive guidance, at best. That’s because CRUD was not developed as a modern way to create API. In fact, CRUD’s origins are in database records.

### By definition, CRUD is more of a cycle than an architectural system. On any dynamic website, there are likely multiple CRUD cycles that exist. For instance, a buyer on an eCommerce site can CREATE an account, UPDATE account information, and DELETE things from a shopping cart.

### A Warehouse Operations Manager using the same site can CREATE shipping records, RETRIEVE them as needed, and UPDATE supply lists. Retrieve is sometimes substituted for READ in the CRUD cycle.

# Database Origins
### The CRUD cycle is designed as a method of functions for enhancing persistent storage—with a database of records, for instance. As the name suggests, persistent storage outlives the processes that created it. These functions embody all the hallmarks of a relational database application.

### In modern software development, CRUD has transcended its origins as foundational functions of a database and now maps itself to design principles for dynamic applications like HTTP protocol, DDS, and SQL.

# REST vs CRUD: what’s the difference?
### CRUD is a cycle that can be mapped to REST, by design. Permanence, as defined in the context of CRUD, is a smart way for applications to mitigate operational commands between clients and services.

### But REST governs much more than permanence within its principles of architecture. Here are some of the ways that REST is not only different than CRUD but also offers much more:

### REST is an architectural system centered around resources and hypermedia, via HTTP protocols
### CRUD is a cycle meant for maintaining permanent records in a database setting
### CRUD principles are mapped to REST commands to comply with the goals of RESTful architecture
## In REST:

### Representations must be uniform with regard to resources
### Hypermedia represents relationships between resources
### Only one entry into an API to create one self-contained interface, then hyperlink to create relationships
