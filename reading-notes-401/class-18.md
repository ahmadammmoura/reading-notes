### What is AWS Lambda?
 ###### Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports.

### When should I use Lambda?

###### Lambda is an ideal compute service for many application scenarios, as long as you can run your application code using the Lambda standard runtime environment and within the resources that Lambda provides.

###### When using Lambda, you are responsible only for your code. Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources to run your code. Because Lambda manages these resources, you cannot log in to compute instances or customize the operating system on provided runtimes. Lambda performs operational and administrative activities on your behalf, including managing capacity, monitoring, and logging your Lambda functions.


### What is Amazon S3?

###### Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.

###### Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, and inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites. The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.



## Review

* Describe “The Cloud”?

  - The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer. ... It's what allows you to make edits to a file in Google Docs on your home computer, and then pick up where you left off when you get to the office. Colleagues can even collaborate on the same document.

* What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

  - Containers are a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. ... Compared to server or machine virtualization approaches, however, containers do not contain operating system images.

* What is auto-scaling?
  - Autoscaling is a cloud computing feature that enables organizations to scale cloud services such as server capacities or virtual machines up or down automatically, based on defined situations such as traffic ir utilization levels.

* What is bandwidth?
  - The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).
