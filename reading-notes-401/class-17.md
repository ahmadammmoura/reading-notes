### Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
  1. A user opens his browser, types in a URL, and presses Enter.
  2. When a user presses Enter, the browser makes a request for that URL.
  3. The request hits the Rails router (config/routes.rb). The router maps the URL to the correct controller and action to handle the request.
  4. The action receives the request and passes it on to the view.
  5. The view renders the page as HTML.
  6. The controller sends the HTML back to the browser. The page loads and the user sees it.

- What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
  * Once developers have written code for a site, they need to place it on the web servers. That process is called code deployment. ... It's called code deployment. It can include code that fixes bugs, adds new features, or upgrades the underlying platform.


## Term
  
  * Server => A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers.

  * Pub/Sub =>  Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) messaging provides instant event notifications for these distributed applications. 

  * WRRC => World Rock'n'Roll Confederation hhhh just kidding its Web Request/Response Cycle

## Preparation Materials

  -  Virtual Machines 

      * A virtual machine, commonly shortened to just VM, is no different than any other physical computer like a laptop, smart phone, or server. It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed. While the parts that make up your computer (called hardware) are physical and tangible, VMs are often thought of as virtual computers or software-defined computers within physical servers, existing only as code.

  * AWS EC2
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
