#### Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures. The goal is to illustrate the types of data used and stored within the system, the relationships among these data types, the ways the data can be grouped and organized and its formats and attributes.

#### Data models are built around business needs. Rules and requirements are defined upfront through feedback from business stakeholders so they can be incorporated into the design of a new system or adapted in the iteration of an existing one.

#### Data can be modeled at various levels of abstraction. The process begins by collecting information about business requirements from stakeholders and end users. These business rules are then translated into data structures to formulate a concrete database design. A data model can be compared to a roadmap, an architect’s blueprint or any formal diagram that facilitates a deeper understanding of what is being designed.

#### Data modeling employs standardized schemas and formal techniques. This provides a common, consistent, and predictable way of defining and managing data resources across an organization, or even beyond.

#### Ideally, data models are living documents that evolve along with changing business needs. They play an important role in supporting business processes and planning IT architecture and strategy. Data models can be shared with vendors, partners, and/or industry peers.

#### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development ?

##### 1-Code flexibility and easier maintenance.

##### 2-With TDD you will get a reliable solution.

##### 3-Save project costs in the long run.

#### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

##### beforeEach() is run before each test afterEach() is run after

#### What is one downside of Test Driven Development ?

##### Probably, the strongest argument against TDD is that the tests need to be maintained because the code has got to. Whenever requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests. But you’re working with TDD. this suggests that you simply got to change the tests first then make the tests pass. So, actually, this disadvantage is that the same as before when writing code that apparently takes an extended time.y takes a long time

#### Why REST?

##### REST aims to make caching easier.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms

#### funcinal programming

##### is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.

#### OOP

##### Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

##### SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational. SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. ... SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.

### NoSQL Data Models.

- Atomic Aggregates.
- Geohash Index.
- Index Table Example.
- Composite Key Index.
- Counting Unique Users using Composite Keys.
- Counting Unique Users using Inverse and Direct Indexes.
- Tree Aggregation.
