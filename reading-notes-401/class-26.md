## Read: Class 26 - Component Based UI

### Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)**

Angular, Vue.js, Ember.js, Meteor, Node.js [hackr.io](https://hackr.io/blog/best-javascript-frameworks)

**2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?**

With Frameworks you have to conform your application to the framework. With a library you’re just bringing some functionality you can use into your applications. 


**Term** | **Definition**
-----|-----
Rendering | Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser. [educative](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-javascript-rendering)
Template | content fragment that is being stored for subsequent use in the document. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template)
State | State describes the status of the entire program or an individual object. It could be text, a number, a boolean, or another data type. It's a common tool for coordinating code. For example, once you update state, a bunch of different functions can instantly react to that change.
