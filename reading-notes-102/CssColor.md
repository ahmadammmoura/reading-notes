### Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions

# There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names

### 1 rgb(red, green, blue) Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.

### 2 A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB. RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF specifying the intensity of the color.

### 3 HSL color HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) 

### 4 and color by name ant it the easyest way 

### Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

### It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
