### Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions

### There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names

### Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

### It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
