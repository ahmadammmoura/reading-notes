### You can find the answer of this question in this infographic photo :

#### As you can see in the previous photo HTML describe the structure by a pyramid with homepage (header) at the top and categories with subcategories beneath it (nav bar) then you can find the main and the footer .

#### HTML uses somthing called elements to Describe the Structure of Pages

#### As we can see through the photo HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

#### HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.


# Extra Markup :

1. HTML <!DOCTYPE> Declaration : All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

2. HTML Comments : HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

3. HTML id Attribute : The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id.

4. HTML class Attribute : The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.

5. HTML Block and Inline Elements : A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

6. Escape Characters : Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.


# HTML5 Layout :

### HTML offers several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

* <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
* <nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
* <section> - Defines a section in a document
* <article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
* <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
* <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
* <details> - Defines additional details
* <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element


##### You can read more about semantic elements in our HTML Semantics chapter.


# Lets talk now about JS (JavaScript) :

#### JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### The script tag is used to define a client-side script (JavaScript).
### The script element either contains script statements, or it points to an external script file through the src attribute.
### Common uses for JavaScript are image manipulation, form validation, and dynamic changes of content.
### To select an HTML element, JavaScript most often uses the document.getElementById() method.
